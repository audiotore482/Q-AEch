FAQ

Q: When does EchOS get updates?
A: Once every month. However if the update contains something big it may be delayed depending on how big it is.


Q: What is EchOS?
A: EchOS is a hobbiest computer operating system with the purpose of being a dos operating system
that can do MOST of the bare bone tasks that a regular operating system can. Like calculate, write text, look at the time, etc.
Its also just a project to develop because oh what the heck ;)

Q: Can you use EchOS as a main system?
A: No no no and no. if your going to be switching over to EchOS as a main driver your going to be losing Almost ALL of functionality. That includes
being able to install software to your computer, browse the internet. EchOS is just a shell with a couple of commands. So no its not worth it at all.
If you want to test EchOS its highly recommend you use it in a virtual machine. Mostly vmware.

Q: Can I edit the code?
A: Yes you can. Its licensed under the gnu public license which you can edit the source code, Fork it and 
redistribute it. You can do basically whatever you want with the source code. Copy it. Whatever. HOWEVER
if you are planning on redistributing it you HAVE to also include the source code like me..

Q: Is this a serious project?
A: Yes and no. This project isn't going to be advertised nor am I getting payed to do this.
EchOS is a hobbiest project to take up my time. However we do seriously try and make the software better.

Q: What language is it written in?
A: C#

Q: How is it possible to write a OS in C#?
A: With the help of software of course. Cosmos is a project that enables to compile C# code over to bootable iso files.

Q: How did you learn to code?
A: By watching a bunch of youtube videos and following along then making my own projects with my knowledge.

Q: Can I contribute to the project?
A: Yes you can! Contributers make the Project better! Please feel free to drop some suggestions into the issues tab.

Q: Whats your favorite language?
A: C# and Java. Which is funny because both of these languages are pretty hated. I love object oriented type languages.

Q: Isn't java for pyschopaths.
A: Oh speaking of java I'm making a compiler using java :D What are you even gonna do about it?

Q: What operating system do you use to develop?
A: I used to use linux as my daily driver but now because of the problems I been having with linux I switched back to my cavehole that is windows.
Windows is a lot less error prone compare to linux. Which is sad because I love linux and if it can do the all the tasks I want to do at a daily basis
I would 500% switch back to it. Rather run good software developers are passionate about then have a 67 year old bill gates spy on me making an operating system
that isn't his..
