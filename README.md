FAQ

Q: When does EchOS get updates?
A: Normally once every month. Unless im busy with something and there maybe a couple of delays.


Q: What is EchOS?
A: EchOS is a hobbiest computer operating system with the purpose of being a dos like operating system
that can do MOST of the bare bone tasks that a regular operating system can. Like calculate, write text, look at the time, etc.
Its also just a project to develop because oh what the heck ;)

Q: Can you use EchOS as a main system?
A: No no no and no. if your going to be switching over to EchOS as a main driver your going to be losing Almost ALL of functionality. That includes
being able to install software to your computer, browse the internet. EchOS is just a shell with a couple of commands. So no its not worth it at all.
If you want to test EchOS its highly recommend you use it in a virtual machine.

Q: Can I edit the code?
A: Yes you can. Its licensed under the gnu public license which you can edit the source code, Fork it and 
redistribute it. You can do basically whatever you want with the source code. Copy it. Whatever. HOWEVER
if you are planning on redistributing it you HAVE to also include the source code like me..

Q: Is this a serious project?
A: Yes and no. This project isn't going to be advertised nor am I getting payed to do this.
EchOS is a hobbiest project to take up my time. However I and my friend do seriously try and make the software better.

Q: What language is it written in?
A: Java

Q: How is it possible to write a OS in Java?
A: That's because EchOS is not (technically) an Operating System. You either run it on
top of your HostOS via the jar file. Or download the bootable ISO that boots into EchOS.
Because the ISO is basically just A java program on top of debian. Not really an OS but
I consider it one and I like it that way :)

Q: How did you learn to code?
A: By watching a bunch of youtube videos and following along then making my own projects with my knowledge.

Q: Can I contribute to the project?
A: Yes you can! Contributers make the Project better! Please feel free to drop some suggestions into the issues tab.

Q: Whats your favorite language?
A: C# and Java. Which is funny because both of these languages are pretty hated. I love object oriented type languages.

Q: Isn't java for pyschopaths.
A: Oh speaking of java I'm making a compiler using java :D What are you even gonna do about it?

Q: What operating system do you use?
A: Linux. I have fully switched from Windows to linux.
I daily drive it for pretty much everything. I had some issues I got those resolved :)
I do everything on linux including development, browsing, gaming, work related stuff, etc.

Q: Is there another developer?
A: Sort of. He works on his own projects
but he helps me out once in a blue moon.
Richard5656 Go check him out :)

Q: How long will this project last or when will it be done?
A: I want this project to go on at least a couple of years
or more then that.

Q: What will you do if you really run out of ideas or when its done entirely.
A: Honestly operating systems are really my thing so I may as well just do what
microsoft did and create EchOS: NT (I know weird.) It's just that operating systems
are super expandable and there are so many things you can add on to them.
